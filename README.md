# Hyperskill_Android_Stopwatch

This was the 2nd project I am completing as part of Jetbrain Academy's Android course.

The goal is to make a pomodoro stopwatch. Though, the end result is just "a stopwatch"
It's not a very good one either, but it certainly helped grasp some of the concepts I need to understand to become a better developer.
